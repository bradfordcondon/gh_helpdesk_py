    "body": "## BUG/ERROR report\r\n<!---\r\nINSTRUCTIONS: The following template is meant to provide the information that will help other Tripal\r\n developers diagnose and reproduce your issue. Follow the directions below to complete the template.\r\n  Feel free to delete sections that are not applicable.\r\n--->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n<!--Please enter the following information (if able). All information is available in your site's administrator report area (Administration Toolbar > Reports > Status Report) -->\r\n\r\n* Tripal Version: 3\r\n* Drupal Version: 7.6\r\n* PostgreSQL Version: 9.6\r\n* PHP Version: 7.1\r\n\r\n### Issue description\r\n<!-- Please describe your issue here \r\nSome information you might want to include: the page you're seeing the issue on,  what behavior \r\nyou're experiencing versus what you expect, really anything you think might best help us help you! -->\r\n\r\nTripal DS uses jquery animations to show/hide Tripal panes. Many modules, including tripal_analysis_interpro and tripal_analysis_blast, draw charts that show up after the page has loaded. Since they are in a hidden container, the width/height of the container is 0 by default. This is messing up how modules compute the dimensions of the chart and causing them to display blank results. See screenshot below.\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n<!-- What steps are necessary to recreate the bug/error?  Clear instructions here will make it easier for\r\n us to fix the problem! -->\r\n\r\nsee issue https://github.com/tripal/tripal_analysis_interpro/issues/24 for more details on reproducing.\r\n\r\n#### Error messages and screenshots\r\n<!-- Please include any error messages you find.  Including them in ``` as below will make the issue\r\n more readable. -->\r\n<!-- Screenshots can be really helpful to describe the problem! -->\r\n\r\n![issue](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17642511/51313489-f8c56200-1a4d-11e9-82a2-c4021a7fe1cb.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Solution \r\n\r\nBy triggering a resize event on the `window` object after the animation has completed, we can simulate the default behavior of the browser. See below for a working example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n           if (typeof Event !== 'undefined') {\r\n               window.dispatchEvent(new Event('resize'));\r\n           }\r\n           else {\r\n               // Support IE\r\n               var event = window.document.createEvent('UIEvents');\r\n               event.initUIEvent('resize', true, false, window, 0);\r\n               window.dispatchEvent(event);\r\n           }\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy adding this code right after this line, the issue would be fixed.\r\nhttps://github.com/tripal/tripal/blob/3244f2dc184513d1c4576fb29b2d72e6f61d4413/tripal_ds/theme/js/tripal_ds.js#L65\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!"

I think we can easily move them over to RTD setups for those modules on their own and then just link to them.  As long as we make sure they continue to use the same example data I don't see a problem with this and it ensures that no extension module docs are in the the core documentation.\r\n\r\nWhat say ye?"

We're here to help! -->\r\n* This feature doesattempt to solve an existing problem with Tripal\r\n* I am open to developing or collaborating on an extension module if this is not a good fit for Tripal Core\r\n<!--- (no pressure here -just good to know upfront :-) ) -->\r\n* This feature is Not Urgent\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n<!--- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. -->\r\nWhen fields load via AJAX (i.e. they are not attached by default to the entity) any content that they provide does not get run through the Drupal.Behaviors infrastructure.  This means that any Javascript/JQuery that normally would get attached to elements in the document don't get attached to returned content.    This is only a problem the first time a page is loaded.  Any subsequent loading of the page uses the field cache so the fields are not loaded via AJAX.   So, on subsequent views of a page all JS in the Drupal.Behaviors should work just fine.  \r\n\r\nWe need some way for the Drupal.Behaviors code to be called the first time a page is loaded.  One approach is to follow what Drupal does with the `ajax_command_invoke` command which is meant to be used in the `hook_ajax_render_alter` function.   It's not clear to me if we can use that approach or if we need to do something similar.   The AJAX calls for loading fields happen from custom JQuery code in the tripal.js file.\r\n\r\n### Your Specific Use Case\r\n<!--- Please describe how you would use this feature in your own Tripal site and why you need it -->\r\nExample where this is a problem is with the Tripal Analysis Blast and Tripal Analysis Interpro modules.  Both of those modules provide a feature viewer for looking at alignments of matches.  Creation of those viewers happens in a Drupal.Behaviors stanza.   Well, actually.... they are being adjusted to be that way.  See https://github.com/tripal/tripal_analysis_blast/issues/8\r\n\r\n### Generally Applicable\r\n<!--- Why do you feel this is generally applicable? -->\r\n<!--- Suggest other use cases if possible. -->\r\nI think anyone who has JavaScript interacting with their field contents will need their AJAX to run both after AJAX loading of field content and on normal page loading when fields are coming from cache.\r\n\r\n"

This is because they are technically \"empty\" as data has not yet been added to them (it gets added via AJAX).  This is incorrect behavior.  They should not be removed from the table until after their data is loaded.  The `tripal_field_group_table_rows_alter` function is the culprit.\r\n\r\n"

    "body": "## BUG/ERROR report\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n\r\nSystem info:\r\nTripal: 7.x-3.0\r\nDrupal : 7.59\r\nPostgres: 9.5.8\r\nPhp: 7.1.23\r\n\r\n### Issue description\r\nHi,\r\nI noticed that some of my automatically created aliases are malformed (missing some tokens).\r\nThis occurs for the mRNA entity type.\r\nMy alias pattern is as follows : features/[obi__organism,TAXRANK:0000005]/[obi__organism,TAXRANK:0000006]/[rdfs__type]/[data__identifier]\r\n\r\nAn expected alias would be : features/Citrus/sinensis/mRNA/PAC:18136223\r\n\r\nBut the created alias looks like this : features///mRNA/\r\n(So there are duplicate errors)\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce\r\nThis one is complicated, because the problem only occurs if the token fields are not in cache. Depending on your setup, you will not see it occurs.\r\n\r\n#### Issues\r\n\r\nLooking at the code, there are actually two separate issues:\r\n1) **In tripal.entities.api.inc**\r\n[Here](https://github.com/tripal/tripal/blob/3606ca5cf8891a068c0dc5ebe6ac48f245252136/tripal/api/tripal.entities.api.inc#L1331)\r\n\r\nWe use the $field_ids variable to monitor the fields missing from cache, however the variable is reset in the first loop:\r\n\r\n```\r\nforeach ($attach_fields as $storage_type => $details) {\r\n      $storage = $details['storage'];\r\n      $fields = $details['fields'];\r\n      $field_ids = array();\r\n            foreach ($fields as $field) {\r\n        $field_ids[$field['id']] = array($entity->id);\r\n      }\r\n```\r\nSo only the last loop actually keep the values. Meaning, if there are more than one storage type for the fields, information is lost. (In my case, the [rdfs__type] token storage is tripal_no_storage, and the other tokens are field_chado_storage.\r\nThis is easily fixed by moving the $field_ids = array(); before the first loop.\r\n\r\n2) **In tripal_field_storage_load**\r\n\r\nThis one is a bit more complicated, but basically, we ignore any fields which are not TripalField class. (like text..)\r\n\r\nIf we compare the hook_field_storage_load implementation in tripal and tripal_chado, we can see that the tripal implementation completely ignore non-TripalField tokens.\r\n\r\n```\r\ntripal_load_include_field_class($field_type);\r\n      if (class_exists($field_type)) {\r\n        $tfield = new $field_type($field, $instance);\r\n        $tfield->load($entity);\r\n      }\r\n\r\n```\r\nWhile tripal_chado implements something to take care of it\r\n```\r\ntripal_load_include_field_class($field_type);\r\n        if (class_exists($field_type) and is_subclass_of($field_type, 'TripalField')) {\r\n          $tfield = new $field_type($field, $instance);\r\n          $tfield->load($entity, array('record' => $record));\r\n        }\r\n        // For text fields that were not handled by a TripalField class we\r\n        // want to automatically expand those fields.\r\n        else {\r\n          if ($schema['fields'][$field_column]['type'] == 'text') {\r\n            $record = chado_expand_var($record, 'field', \"$field_table.$field_column\");\r\n            $entity->{$field_name}['und'][0]['value'] = $record->$field_column;\r\n            // Text fields that have a text_processing == 1 setting need a\r\n            // special 'format' element too:\r\n            if (array(key_exists('text_processing', $instance['settings']) and\r\n                $instance['settings']['text_processing'] == 1)) {\r\n              // TODO: we need a way to write the format back to the\r\n              // instance settings if the user changes it when using the form.\r\n              $entity->{$field_name}['und'][0]['format'] = array_key_exists('format', $instance['settings']) ? $instance['settings']['format'] : 'full_html';\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich means that text tokens are simply empty in the current implementation.\r\nTo fix this, I used the implementation from tripal_chado and added it in tripal. It seems to work.\r\n\r\nSorry if this is not clear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The PMC's role is to provide oversight over code development. It ensures quality standards, approves feature requests, and accepts pull requests.  The Advisory Committee is meant to provide guidance for the future of Tripal.\r\n\r\nHere's the current proposal put forth by @mestato:\r\n\r\n1. Meetings: once per year (January, pre-hackathon with teleconference option?) and as needed other than that, can be called by PMC\r\n2. Director: elected by board at January meeting, responsible for calling votes, calling additional meetings if needed, and making sure meeting notes are posted and communicated to PMC\r\n3. Responsibilities: board members agree to serve for one year at a time, beginning by attend the yearly board meeting (in person or online) and to respond to issues in a timely manner when requested by the PMC or other board members. Their responsibility is to provide high level advice on steering Tripal which may relate to overall approach, development priorities, upgrade timelines, funding, etc. Issues will be available for full community discussion for x number of weeks prior to a vote\r\n4. Eligibility: anyone who has led a group who has published or maintained/updated a publicly available Tripal module within the past 2 years or has funding for Tripal development (core or extension). \r\n5. Election: anyone who is eligible and willing is welcome\r\n6. Terms: indefinite since its all volunteer based\r\n7. Decision making: Consensus based, vote called when needed by director, all objections recorded in meeting notes\r\n8. Agenda: items can be set by anyone on PMC or board\r\n9. PMC seat: at least one person from PMC has a seat on the board\r\n10. PMC issues: if PMC wants the board to weigh in on an issue outside the yearly meeting, they can request a meeting by notifying the director"

Instead, we need a way for the entity object to maintain a count of the number of pagers so that it can then be used to set the index number for each pager.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    "body": "There has been a discussion among the Project Management Committee (PMC) to implement a module rating system such that others who want to potentially use extension modules for Tripal can judge how well it might work for them before installing it.   It's easy to say a module is Tripal v3 compatible but that doesn't mean it properly uses the Tripal API, or that it provides generic configuration such that another site could easily set it up and use it.  \r\n\r\nThe PMC proposes a set of qualifications for rating modules as Bronze, Silver and Gold with different criteria that  developers can use to judge their modules. The initial list of potential criteria are below. We open this up for discussion for all developers of Tripal extension modules to comment.  Please comment if you think changes should be made to the lists below.\r\n\r\n**Bronze**: \r\n* Any Tripal version\r\n   * Has a public release that follows Drupal release naming rules.\r\n   * Should install on a Tripal site appropriate for the versions it supports.\r\n   * Defines any custom tables or mviews in the install file (if applicable).\r\n   * Provides Installation and admin instructions README.md (or RTD)\r\n   * Has a license (distributed with module)\r\n* Tripal v3 specific\r\n   *  Adds any needed controlled vocabulary terms in the install file  (if applicable)\r\n\r\n**Silver:**\r\n* Any Tripal version\r\n  * Follows Drupal code standards (how to measure this?)\r\n  * Use tripal API functions (is this too generic)?\r\n  * ~~Uses the Chado API: Queries Chado using chado_generate_var, chado_expand_var, the ChadoRecord class or chado_xxx_record functions (except for complicated queries).~~\r\n  * Provides an admin interface to allow for customization\r\n* Tripal v3 specific:\r\n  * Uses the TripalField class to add data to pages (if applicable).\r\n\r\n**Gold:**\r\n* Any Tripal version\r\n   * Unit testing is implemented using PHPUnit with the TripalTestSuite or something similar.\r\n   * Continuous integrating is setup (e.g. such as with TravisCI).  \r\n      * Required: execution of unit tests\r\n      * Optional (but encouraged):  code sniffing and testing coverage reports.\r\n   * Project should have a public development branch (following Drupal naming rules) to encourage collaboration and pull requests.\r\n   * Extensive documentation for the module (similar to Tripal User's Guide).\r\n* Tripal v3 specific: \r\n   * Imports data via Tripal's importer class\r\n   * Tripal 3 fields are \r\n      * Fully compatible with web services\r\n      * The elementInfo function is fully implemented.\r\n      * query and queryOrder functions fully implemented.\r\n   * Web Services uses Tripal's Web Service Classes.\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\nThe standards will be given a version number. This way if the rules change we can refer to the version number for the rules.\r\n\r\nSample badges to post on a website?\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1719352/49599185-30ac9600-f935-11e8-87d1-32fa288f8b50.png)\r\n\r\nedit: scratched the Chado API requirement from Silver"

    "body": "So, it is possible to integrate our Doxygen style commenting in Tripal with Sphynx and Read the Docs.  That would place our User's Guide, Developer's Handbook and the API all in one RTD interface.  It would allow us to update the API quicker because we wouldn't have to fight with the Drupal API site we currently maintain.   I really like this idea but there are some caveats.\r\n\r\n1.  We have to commit the Doxygen generated XML into the repository so RTD can find it.\r\n2.  We have to add a requirements.txt file so that Sphynx can install the breathe library\r\n3.  We have to manually create a page for each API in our docs folder and use breathe directives to point to the proper API.  It's not hard to do, but just requires someone to do it.\r\n4.  We have to edit *all* of our API functions and add the input type to all of them or breath croaks!  I'll put in a request on the breathe GitHub to see if they can fix that. Otherwise this will be a lot of work and may break stuff!\r\n\r\nWe did this for the Tripal Galaxy module.  An example can be seen here:  https://tripal-galaxy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/API/api_funcs.html"

When adding a new entity for a content type that has relationships it's not clear how to refer to the record being added such that it can be used in a relationship. It's only possible to set relationships for entities that already exist and editing them.\r\n> Its own name wont fill out the autocomplete box. I can infer that it needs to be genus species based on the autocomplete... Maybe the field instance setting description should be dynamic and describe what the name field is going to consist of?

Then you start with a radio button that says \"this record is the subject\" and \"this record is the object\", and only display the other box for looking up the \"other\" record.\r\n\r\n~~2.  If a relationship type (e.g. 'part_of') has two words rather than one then the widget gives a validation error.~~  (see new issue here #801 BC)[original screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1719352/48812484-6ae82780-ece7-11e8-94c7-80bafec84140.png)\r\n3.  When creating a relationship for the project content type the word \"project\" seems to have an odd pattern for bolded words.

Unable to remove a relationship.\r\n> Its not possible to remove a relationship with this widget. I can manually unset everything, however, the field then fails validation.\r\n\r\n5. Formatter for shows \"feature\" rather then the content type (e.g. \"Genetic Marker\").

However, the job keeps stalling at around 37% of parsed lines.\r\n\r\nThere is no error output from the Drush command. The Tripal Jobs list just says, \"Error.\" So I'm not sure how to troubleshoot.\r\n\r\nI first increased the PHP memory_limit value, as advised in the tutorial, to 2048M. I then raised it to 5120M. Both times, the job stalled at about 37% (36.74% for the former, 37.71% for the latter). It seems like the difference should have been much different if that was the issue, but I don't know.\r\n\r\nPlease advise if you have any advice on how to move past this stalling, with no clear error message, of a GFF load.\r\n\r\nThank you!"

The solution we came up with for #732 was to have the relationship field put the returned child feature record in the field (but not in the value.) . This is OK, but could be redundant if lots of fields are doing it.  Instead, they could update the entity itself, but, because we dont think the entity is cached, it wouldnt be available to other fields."

    "body": "## Feature Request/Discussion\r\n\r\nBackground #742 \r\n\r\nI wrote a guide demonstrating field-level permissions implemented ia the drupal field_permissions module, but web services dont support them.  If you make a field admin only, two things happen:\r\n* admin only fields show up in web service requests\r\n* You get this warning:\r\n\r\n```\r\nNotice: Undefined offset: 0 in TripalContentService_v0_1->addEntityField() (line 383 of /Users/bc/tripal/sites/all/modules/tripal/tripal_ws/includes/TripalWebService/TripalContentService_v0_1.inc).\r\n```\r\n\r\n## resolution\r\nAt first glance, looks easy to resolve the warning by adding this to the web services class just prior to here: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/tripal/tripal/blob/bfca9765a5ef7aece7b4355c886d91513a89cadb/tripal_ws/includes/TripalWebService/TripalContentService_v0_1.inc#L383\r\n\r\n\r\n```php\r\n  if (empty($values)){\r\n        return;\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      // If the value is an array and this is the field page then all of those\r\n      // key/value pairs should be added directly to the response.\r\n      if (is_array($values[0])) {\r\n```\r\n\r\nadding this also causes the ws to work how i'd expect: it isnt returned since we didnt have the permission enabled for an anonymous user.\r\n\r\nprobably also need to add a case for where cardinality != 1....  what do you think?  This would make the ws behave how i expect (field isnt shown on web services), and it resolves the php warning.\r\n\r\n"

    "body": "I am hoping to use the Drupal Features module (Please see #740  ) to develop field configurations on a dev set and deploy on a live site (which i myself dont have access to).\r\n\r\nThere are two hurdles.  1) . bundle_ids may not be consistent across sites.  For now, I just suggest relabeling manually.  2) (**this issue**):  fields are imported disabled by default.  \r\nConsider the entire point of this Features pipeline is to export field configurations, i htink its clear that providing a way to import them enabled would be ideal.  Is there a way I can do this, in the field configuration or something?  If not, is it feasible to offer some way to do so (for example give the drupal feature module special override?) . Or, is this *still* a bad idea, and we want admins to have to enable the display of the imported fields?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

The tutorial I attach a file upload field (for a FASTA file) to analysis, put it in a tripal pane, etc on a dev site, export it, and import it into another site.\r\n\r\n* Do you think some port of this would be helpful in the admin guide area in our tripal documentation?  I can port it over.\r\n\r\n* Please see sibling issue #741 regarding feature configs getting loaded disabled.\r\n\r\nThanks to @shawnamspoor for discussing hte module with me a bit."

    "body": "## Feature Request/Discussion\r\nThis issue is a splinter from #100 .  It's a feature request as @laceysanderson and I agree that having better gene pages is a **very desirable thing**. \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nGene pages aren't great out of the box, and fields just arent designed to work with a typical gene setup.  What do I mean by that?  In short, **Genes need to access child feature information** and they dont, or they do in limited ways.\r\n\r\nLets consider three fields.  I have a vanilla gene here at \r\nhttp://167.99.232.220/gene/185\r\nI loaded FASTA sequences for scaffolds, mRNA, CDS, and proteins.  NONE of this information is available on the gene page!  Neither would annotations associated these feature types (unless we loaded them associating via the parent gene via regexp.).\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Field 1 - transcripts\r\n\r\n[Transcripts](https://github.com/tripal/tripal/blob/7.x-3.x/tripal_chado/includes/TripalFields/so__transcript/so__transcript.inc)\r\nThe transcript field on the gene page doesnt provide sequences, or any information other than location.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Field 2 - sequence \r\n\r\n[Sequences](https://github.com/tripal/tripal/blob/7.x-3.x/tripal_chado/includes/TripalFields/data__sequence/data__sequence.inc) . Per tripal's general philosophy, the sequence field only look as the targeted feature, not related features.  Because I didnt load in the gene FASTA, theres nothing to display, even though i loaded in 4 other feature type fastas, plus the GFF. I thould be able to infer the gene sequence via the GFF, just for starters.\r\n\r\n#### Field 3 - protein sequence\r\n[Field code](https://github.com/tripal/tripal/tree/7.x-3.x/tripal_chado/includes/TripalFields/data__protein_sequence)\r\nThere are protein sequences associated with this gene, but **indirectly** via the mrna -> CDS.    The protein sequences field therefore does not find them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Solution\r\n\r\nSome considerations...\r\n* I'd like the solution to work for all feature types, if possible.  Meaning, if im on feature X, it should find and display all features linked to it, nomatter how indirectly.  The field config might allow excluding display of certain SO terms if thast too much.\r\n* Solution should be fast.  We are iterating through each feature_relationship.  I dont want a suite of fields doing that independently and redundantly.  So, we're probably either working on one mega field that displays all child-feature info, or, developing a shared architecture so that it only gets called once per page and cached.\r\n* Sites will want access to, at a minimum, the following info from all children:\r\n  - annotations (feature_cvterm, also blast data)\r\n  - properties  (featureprops)\r\n  - sequences \r\n   -  coordinate info (featureloc)\r\n\r\nPoint two sounds to me very similar to cvtermpath for features.  Cvtermpath is a nightmare, BUT for features its much easier to prevent infinite loops, we arent dealing with stanzas, etc.\r\n\r\nPoint three makes it clear that we are talking about multilpe fields, since displaying annotations AND sequences in the same place is a bit much.\r\n"

I thought I'd reach out to the community to see if anyone know of any solutions that meet our needs well.\r\n\r\n### Impetus\r\n\r\nTravis CI is great for code testing, but code reports provide more of a snapshot of the state of your code, with CI.  \r\n\r\nSome things this would add to Tripal (:\r\n\r\n* STYLING.  If a PR doesnt meet Drupal style standards, our report would tell us.\r\n* Test Coverage.  We would get tools to view test coverage.  Further when people contribute code we would know what the test coverage for their new coverage looks like.\r\n* Problematic code.   Files that are poor code will get graded as such and we can be aware that they need some help.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Options\r\n\r\nWhen considering options, we need to consider the services offered, the pricing (should be free for an open source project), and the Drupal support  (we need to at least be able to configure the service to expect Drupal's weird extensions, and code styling obviously needs to be set to Drupal standards.)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Configure Travis and PHPUnit to generate reports\r\n\r\nThis is definitely possible.  [see these slides](https://lullabot.github.io/drupal8ci-slides/#/) The below services are flashier but it's an option.\r\n\r\n#### Code Climate\r\n\r\nhttps://codeclimate.com/\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Codacity\r\n\r\nhttps://www.codacy.com/\r\n\r\n\r\nI'll try and update our options as i try them and get asense for how easy/hard it is to configure for a drupal project.

Follow the directions below to complete the template.\r\n  Feel free to delete sections that are not applicable.\r\n--->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n<!--Please enter the following information (if able). All information is available in your site's administrator report area (Administration Toolbar > Reports > Status Report) -->\r\n\r\n* Tripal Version: 3.x\r\n* Drupal Version: 7.59\r\n* PostgreSQL Version: 9.5\r\n* PHP Version: 7.x\r\n\r\n### Issue description\r\n<!-- Please describe your issue here \r\nSome information you might want to include: the page you're seeing the issue on,  what behavior \r\nyou're experiencing versus what you expect, really anything you think might best help us help you! -->\r\n\r\nI don't know if it's really a bug, but I noticed that deploying a tripal 3 instance is much slower than it was for tripal 2. Like >15min instead of <5min.\r\nIt makes testing more painful, locally, and with travis (for tripal itself, but also python-tripal).\r\nIt is the `Creating common Tripal Content Types` step that takes a lot of time.\r\nI've looked into the code a little: it seems like calls to the drupal `field_info_max_weight` functions are slow, when this function calls `field_info_instances` and `field_info_extra_fields`\r\nAnd `field_info_max_weight` is called from tripal like this (at least):\r\n`tripal_create_bundle_fields` -> `field_create_instance` -> `_field_write_instance` -> `field_info_max_weight`\r\n\r\nAs a clue, there is a warning in the doc of `field_info_instances` talking about using `field_info_field_map` instead.\r\n\r\nI don't know if there's anything that can be done, I gave up when I saw that it could come from the drupal code... Just creating the issue in case someone is interested. Feel free to close.\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nInstall a new Tripal instance and wait.\r\n\r\n<!-- What steps are necessary to recreate the bug/error?  Clear instructions here will make it easier for\r\n us to fix the problem! -->\r\n#### Error messages and screenshots\r\n<!-- Please include any error messages you find.  Including them in ``` as below will make the issue\r\n more readable. -->\r\n<!-- Screenshots can be really helpful to describe the problem! -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n"

Here is our use case:\r\n>Our curator uses the web interface to delete unwanted pubs that were imported by the Tripal pub importer. After she deletes the pubs, they still show up in the Tripal Pub Search (/find/publications) results, even after applying you fix.\r\n\r\nI'm inclined to agree with him.  here was my response:\r\n\r\n>Deleting a tripal entity, intentionally, does not delete the chado record (thats my recollection of this discussion i've had with stephen).\r\n\r\n>I think this is not always the desired behavior, for example in the case described. I would go so far as to say that deleting the chado record should be the default behavior. That said, maybe we need to support both? Deleting the record brings up a dialogue that lets you specify you want to also delete the associated chado record ?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### note\r\n\r\nPlease do not confuse this issue with the bug reported in #652 and its corresponding PR #653 \r\n\r\n"

Primarily, I don't think it drives home the value of using Tripal as a means for interacting with a larger community of developers and genomic sites.  The true strength of Tripal is not so much all of the functionality that it has but rather the community around it and the ability to share code and collaborate with others.  \r\n\r\nI would like to rework that text on the website.  This issue  is meant to collect our thoughts on what really should be stated about Tripal on the home page and about pages of Tripal.info."

Create a new feature for each version and mark the old one obsolete? How do I make it easy for users to find the correct ID when they don't know there has been an update?  I have some ideas, but it would require the geneID and mRNAIDs to have different bases, ie nv2g00005394  (change g->m) for gene and nv2m00005394 for mRNA.\r\n\r\nAny advice would be fantastic!!!\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\nSofia\r\n\r\n\r\n"

If TRUE, it should store the file somewhere, and attach that file location as a property to the analysis the importer is associated with.    The term could be TripalImporter_file_location, and the value would be the path to the file.\r\n\r\nBingo bango, you can now write a simple field that attaches to analysis, and offers a download of the raw data. \r\n\r\n### Your Specific Use Case\r\nOur biomaterial loader for tripal_analysis_expression allows users to download expression data at the analysis level.  Currently we just re-generate the file from the data in the db, but for big data sets this takes a long time.  In discussing how to fix by cacheing hte file ahead of time, we realized... its the same file we fed the Importer!  So, we would make our expression data Importer cache the file somewhere, and then modify our field to retrieve that file.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Generally Applicable\r\n\r\nTake the FASTA and the GFF loader.  If you stored the files afterwards, you could write a GFF and FASTA download field that attaches to analysis and offers a simple way to download the raw file.\r\n\r\nWe currently manually put this file somewhere, and then write html to link the download, which goes in the description field.  A universal field approach is **much saner**.  It lmakes it easier to have a more consistent UX too!\r\n\r\nI think this is a great feature for any site that wants to make raw data, particularly FASTA or GFF files, available to users.  If the variable is FALSE by default, its totally backwards compatible.\r\n\n\n<!-- probot = {\"440286\":{\"who\":\"bradfordcondon\",\"what\":\"\",\"when\":\"2018-11-14T09:00:00.000Z\"}} -->"

    "body": "<!---\r\nINSTRUCTIONS: Our intent is to use github as an open forum to help community members connect.\r\nIf you are looking to do any of the following, you are in the right place! and Thank You!\r\n  - Ask for help/documentation/clarification of Tripal Functionality and Site Building/Management\r\n  - Discuss controlled vocabulary terms for your data\r\n  - Ask for input on site/module design questions\r\n  - State your intent to develop a specific extension module\r\n  - Really any type of discussion or question -we want to hear from you!\r\n--->\r\nIn our Tripal User's Meeting from Today ([see meeting notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NSU7Q-J2HBU5T3Yp3hvGNAztrVAX1AdojNX5t5LiA8Q/edit#heading=h.4moho3kt5r8d)), we discussed how we should approach Tripal v 4.  Here is a summary of the motivations and challenges.\r\n\r\n**Challenges**\r\n-  The learning curve of Tripal + Chado + Drupal can be too much for new programmers\r\n-  Drupal's hook system is a bit foreign to programmers trained in object oriented languages that have built in abstraction and member proctions.\r\n-  For small sites, hiring a local expert Drupal programmer can be challenging. These programmers often make more money than an academic group can support.  Additionally for small sites individuals must perform multiple duties and Drupal training can be overwhelming given their full list of duties.\r\n- PHP: is not the language that informaticians and data scientists are using.  And it is these individuals who are most likely to want resources that Tripal provides.  It is challenging for some groups to find not just Drupal programmers but individuals who understand data science/informatics.\r\n-  Many folks desire to use other web frameworks for various reasons:\r\n  - The programmers that they have access to come with a variety of existing experience with other frameworks. It can be faster to get things accomplished by taking advantage of other current experience.\r\n  - Some frameworks are easier to develop specific visualizations or tools.  \r\n  - It is not clear how to integrate these frameworks into Drupal.\r\n\r\n**Needs:**\r\n- We need to preserve the sense of community that has built around a single framework (PHP/Chado/Drupal). it is our community, cooperativeness, and sharing that has helped secure funding among our respective groups.\r\n- We need to support those sites that are heavily invested in Drupal and remember that Drupal provides much of the infrastructure needed to build large interactive research communities around data.\r\n\r\n**Proposed Solution**\r\nTo address the challenges above it was decided to explore the idea of dividing Tripal into two pieces: a library that houses the non-Drupal components of Tripal, and a Drupal module that interacts with the library to provide a Drupal interface for Tripal.  This approach would allow others to take advantage of the infrastructure provided by Tripal without being forced to use Drupal.  And for folks who do want to use Drpual it would allow for easier integration of other frameworks with the Drupal site that can  use the same underlying API to access data in Chado (or other data stores).  We will perform a proof of concept (POC) study to see if Python is an appropriate choice for the Tripal library.  Python was selected to try to help promote greater adoption of Tripal by informaticists who are traditionally not web developers with no experience using PHP.  Python offers a lower barrier to entry for these folks to be involved in web-development.\r\n\r\n**Proof of Concept**\r\nTo help ease and promote long-term adoption we will perform a proof of concept (POC) study.  The POC will do two things:\r\n1.  It will test how well a Tripal Python library can interact with a PHP-based Tripal module for Drupal, and how much work it will take to ensure a Python library can provide all of the structure needed to not interfere with existing Tripal sites and their current development plans.\r\n2.  It will test to see how well the Tripal community will rally around a Python implementation.  Moving \"core\" Tripal code to Python is not an easy undertaking and we need support of the larger Tripal community to make it happen in a timely manner.   Note: if we cannot garner enough support for the Python migration then separation of core Tripal code into a PHP library would be more pratical\r\n\r\nHere we welcome comments, suggestions and protests about this plan!"

It was added specifically to help with fixes/re-write of the OBO loader and as such was merged in without it's full featureset in order for the fixes to make it into the stable 3.0 release. This Issue describes the features and checks needed for the class before it's ready to replace portions of the existing API. NOTE: current API functions will remain for backwards compatibility but will become wrappers for the class functions.\r\n\r\n### Fixes and Features Needed\r\nFrom the original review of the PR:\r\n- We need to be able to specify values through the foreign key:\r\n```php\r\n             $record->setValues([\r\n               'name' => 'My Favourite Plant',\r\n               'uniquename' => 'Plectranthus scutellarioides Trailing Plum Brocade',\r\n               'organism_id' => [ 'genus' => 'Tripalus', 'species' => 'databasica' ],\r\n               'type_id' => [ 'name' => 'sample', 'cv_id' => [ 'name' => 'Sample processing and separation techniques' ] ],\r\n             ]);\r\n```\r\n - We need to follow foreign keys when returning values.\r\n - It needs to be a little more fault tolerant.\r\n      - In update & delete, if there is no record_id set, we can execute find to attempt to look it up\r\n      - Need to support the same validation we have in the existing functions.\r\n - We don't have support for many of the options we did using the api functions directly.\r\n - We can only select a single record? This is a barrier to replacing chado_select_record().\r\n - Improve performance by using `RETURNING` for insert to retrieve the newly inserted id.\r\n\r\n### Points for Discussion\r\n- Should ChadoRecord->values() be a `chado variable` and should we have generate/expand var functionality in this class?\r\n- What should be checked when values are set? This was easy in the original API functions because it was specific to the action being performed but with the class it's less clear. For example, If I'm intending to find, I should be aloud to not set all required values but if I'm executing an insert/update, then I need them. Perhaps required should be checked in insert/update rather then setValues?\r\n- Should we throw exceptions or use tripal_report_error? or both?"

    "body": "Hi again,\r\n\r\nI need to change the type of the field 'value' in the feature_relationship table. It is of type text, but we need to store numbers and want to be able to use this field as a numeric one, for example, to filter by these values in Views. The table has no data now. (This field is meant for comments and does not have any relationship with other fields/tables, so it does not seem to be a problem to change it.) The field type CAN be changed in psql, but this does not affect the way this table is seen by Drupal.\r\n\r\nI see that many change field types programmatically in Drupal using hook_update_N (with the functions db_query update and/or db_change_field). Looks like this way can only be used with public tables.\r\n\r\nCould you please hint how it is possible to change a field type in a Chado table? (Is it possible?)\r\nI was trying to access the Chado schema via different functions from the API like chado_get_schema(), and then use db_change_field, with no luck so far. Tripal API from other modules work fine, so there are some things which I seem to be missing here...\r\n\r\nIs this the way to do it? Or would you recommend something else?\r\n\r\nTripal 7-2.1\r\nChado 1.3\r\n"

Thus if you are going to provide pages you might want to include more summary fields based on materialized views to provide more useful content to users. |\r\n| supercontig                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | SO:0000148 |                          | This term is a synonym for scaffoldand should be used for such                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\r\n| contig                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | SO:0000149 |                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\r\n| gene                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | SO:0000704 |                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\r\n| mRNA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | SO:0000234 |                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\r\n| sequence_variant                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | SO:0001060 | SNP, MNP, Indel          | We recommend grouping all variants into a single content type in order to provide a common page layout across variant types and to make searching across variants (e.g. show me all variants in a given region) easier.

Ideally there would be a very generic views handler that would select from the table the field is attached to finding the currently used values and using them to populate the list. I could also allow it to be configured to just provide all values from the linked table as a faster option. Autocomplete would query on the fly.\r\n\r\nI would generically implement it for all foreign key fields and use tokens from the table the foreign key references to make the human-readable option generic. For example, for the feature table, you could use a select list for the organism_id, type_id and dbxref_id; for the organism_id select list the tokens available would be all columns from the organism table.\r\n\r\nThis is handled in Drupal by having two fields you can add in the views UI: `[field name]` for the straight textfield and `[field name] (Allowed Values)` for the select list. For Drupal Fields the allowed values are set in the instance settings and thus no querying is needed.\r\n\r\nAre we content with two options in the views UI for each field attached to a chado foreign key? Also are we content querying for the options? Or should I require options be set in the views ui?\r\n\r\n### Your Specific Use Case\r\n<!--- Please describe how you would use this feature in your own Tripal site and why you need it -->\r\nSpecifically I need:\r\n- organism_id => scientific names\r\n- type_id => cvterm name\r\n- project/analysis => name\r\n\r\n### Generally Applicable\r\n<!--- Why do you feel this is generally applicable? -->\r\n<!--- Suggest other use cases if possible. -->\r\nI feel select lists in exposed filters are more friendly to users and general expected in web forms."

Clear instructions here will make it easier for\r\n us to fix the problem! -->\r\nAfter enabling a module that defines fields such as [tripal_analysis_expression](https://github.com/tripal/tripal_analysis_expression):\r\n1. attach the field to a bundle. \r\n  Structure -> Tripal content types -> Organism -> manage fields -> + Check for new fields\r\n2. make sure the field displays as expected\r\n3. Disable the module\r\n\r\n#### Error messages and screenshots\r\n<!-- Please include any error messages you find.

Follow the directions below to complete the template.\r\n  Feel free to delete sections that are not applicable.\r\n--->\r\n\r\nFollow-up Issue for #351.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n<!--Please enter the following information (if able). All information is available in your site's administrator report area (Administration Toolbar > Reports > Status Report) -->\r\n\r\n* Tripal Version: 7.x-3.x\r\n* Drupal Version: n/a\r\n* PostgreSQL Version: n/a\r\n* PHP Version: n/a\r\n\r\n### Issue description\r\n<!-- Please describe your issue here \r\nSome information you might want to include: the page you're seeing the issue on,  what behavior \r\nyou're experiencing versus what you expect, really anything you think might best help us help you! -->\r\nCurrently creating a Tripal Collection from a Drupal Search API view is very slow (e.g. 5 min to create a collection with 400 members). \r\n\r\nThis is due to needing to lookup the bundle for each item in the collection in order to create it.\r\nhttps://github.com/tripal/tripal/blob/7.x-3.x/tripal/views_handlers/tripal_views_handler_area_collections.inc#L413-L421 \r\n```php\r\n  // First, determine the bundle for each entity in our resultset.\r\n  $entities = array();\r\n  $results = unserialize($form_state['values']['results']);\r\n  foreach($results as $r) {\r\n    // Retrieve the bundle for the current entity.\r\n    // ASSUMPTION: all search results are TripalEntities.\r\n    $wrapper = entity_metadata_wrapper('TripalEntity', $r->entity);\r\n    $bundle = $wrapper->getBundle();\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we need to loop through all bundles to get the list of fields attached to them.\r\nhttps://github.com/tripal/tripal/blob/7.x-3.x/tripal/views_handlers/tripal_views_handler_area_collections.inc#L450-L458\r\n```php\r\n  foreach($entities as $bundle_name => $bundle_col) {\r\n    $field_ids = array();\r\n    foreach (field_info_instances('TripalEntity', $bundle_name) as $field) {\r\n      $field_ids[] = $field['field_id'];\r\n    }\r\n    $bundle_col['fields'] = $field_ids;\r\n    $collection->addBundle($bundle_col);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n**NOTE: This is not an issue for non-Drupal Search API views, since they are created specific to a single bundle (no need to look it up) and fields are looked up during loading of the view (and cached) rather then during collection creation. We can't look up fields during loading of the view since we don't know which bundles our results include.**\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!-- What steps are necessary to recreate the bug/error?  Clear instructions here will make it easier for\r\n us to fix the problem! -->\r\n1. Set up the Drupal Search API as indicated in this tutorial: http://tripal.info/tutorials/v3.x/searching/search-api\r\n2. Edit the search view created in the tutorial to add Global: Tripal Content Data Collections to the footer.\r\n3. On the search page, create a tripal collection.\r\n"

    "body": "Tripal Versions: 2.x and 3.x (13/06/2018)\r\nDrupal Version: not relevant\r\nPostgreSQL Version: not relevant\r\nPHP Version: not relevant\r\n\r\nIn tripal_core.chado_query.api.inc, the chado_query function prefixes tables using the curly brackets {} for Chado tables and square brackets [] for Drupal tables. The following piece of code is currently used:\r\n```\r\n $chado_schema_name = chado_get_schema_name('chado');\r\n    $drupal_schema_name = chado_get_schema_name('drupal');\r\n    $sql = preg_replace('/\\{(.*?)\\}/', $chado_schema_name.'.$1', $sql);\r\n    $sql = preg_replace('/\\[(\\w+)\\]/', $drupal_schema_name.'.$1', $sql);\r\n```\r\nThis raises 2 issues:\r\n1) when the user wants to use curly or square brackets for other things that table names, it will be a problem. For instance, if I'd like to select any feature with a uniquename that begins with capital A or B, I would write a query like that (use \"drush php\" for testing):\r\n```\r\n$sql_query = \"SELECT * FROM {feature} WHERE uniquename ~ '^[AB]';\"\r\n$results = chado_query($sql_query);\r\ndrupal_set_message('Query: ' . $results->getQueryString());\r\n\r\n```\r\nSuch code will in fact return nothing while there should be some results as the query will be turned into:\r\n`SELECT * FROM chado.feature WHERE uniquename ~ '^public.AB';`\r\n\r\nThen\r\n\r\n2) replacing the square brackets with just \"public.\" will break Drupal behavior: Drupal uses curly brakets arround table names in order to prefix them with the database prefix used by the Drupal installation (@see https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/includes%21database%21database.inc/7.x ). For some reasons, people may want or need to prefix all Drupal tables with something and removing curly brackets around Drupal table names prevents Drupal from doing its job.\r\nSome people may wonder why using a table prefix: there are many cases in which it can actually be useful. The first one I think of is when you want to share Drupal users between several Drupal instances. It is possible to specify in your settings.php files that the user table are not prefixed while all the other Drupal tables are. Then when a user is created on a Drupal instance or another, it will be also created on other (well it's a bit more tricky than this but it works).\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm sorry I don't have a pull request to fix that (yet) and I didn't came up with a good solution yet but if people have ideas to discuss for a fix, feel free. I just wanted to raise the issue so it would be known and people having trouble using queries like mines would understand why sometimes, they might not have expected results... (and also, using Tripal prevents them from using Drupal table prefixing feature).\r\n"

    "body": "### Overview \r\n\r\nI'd like to define a field that has a widget that allows you to enter a file system path.  Then it will have a formatter that runs a javascript app on that file.  Nothing is stored in chado.\r\n\r\nTo this end I define a field instance where the widget is of type `text_textfield`, it uses a custom formatter, and it stores the text in type `field_sql_storage`. \r\nIs this the correct approach?  If so can I get some help with what I'm doing wrong?\r\n\r\n  for example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n $field_name = 'local__cmap_viewer';\r\n    $instances[$field_name] = [\r\n      'field_name' => $field_name,\r\n      'entity_type' => $entity_type,\r\n      'bundle' => $bundle->name,\r\n      'label' => 'cMap',\r\n      'description' => 'A cmap visualization field.',\r\n      'required' => FALSE,\r\n      'storage' => [\r\n        'type' => 'field_sql_storage',\r\n      ],\r\n      'settings' => [\r\n        'auto_attach' => FALSE,\r\n        'text_processing' => 0,\r\n        'max_length' => 10485760,\r\n      ],\r\n      'widget' => [\r\n        'type' => 'text_textfield',\r\n        'required' => FALSE,\r\n        'settings' => [\r\n        ],\r\n      ],\r\n      'display' => [\r\n        'default' => [\r\n          'label' => 'hidden',\r\n          'type' => 'local__cmap_viewer_formatter',\r\n          'settings' => [],\r\n        ],\r\n      ],\r\n    ];\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy [current attempt is here](https://github.com/statonlab/tripal_cmap_loader/blob/base_viewer_field/includes/tripal_cmap_loader.fields.inc).\r\n\r\nWhat i *can* do is create the field, and use the plain text field (it shows up as a widget).  however theres something wrong with the field storage and/or the widget configuration.\r\n\r\n### Problems\r\n\r\nNo matter what I get undefined indexed notices for the field widget when editing/creating. \r\n\r\n```\r\nNotice: Undefined index: max_length in text_field_widget_form() (line 514 of /Users/chet/UTK/tripal/modules/field/modules/text/text.module).\r\nNotice: Undefined index: text_processing in text_field_widget_form() (line 549 of /Users/chet/UTK/tripal/modules/field/modules/text/text.module).\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've tried adding these keys to the widget settings, and also to the field settings.\r\n\r\nfurthermore, the storage doesnt work: When I submit and go back to re-edit, the field is nulled."

Should we move some code out as extensions? (i.e. for Tripal v4/Drupal 8)\r\n2)  What protocol should we follow for pull requests?  Do we establish quality standards, rules about who should accept pull requests and how do we resolve conflicts if there is a difference of opinion on a pull request.\r\n3)  Dorrie has suggested we form an advisory committee to provide high-level guidance to the Tripal community.   What are your thoughts on that and what would that committee look like?\r\n"

    "body": "### System information\r\n* Tripal Version: 7.x-3.x\r\n* Drupal Version: 7.x\r\n\r\n### Issue description\r\nCurrently the Tripal Collections Views Handler requires the attached view to be using the query plugin `tripal_views_query`. This is not the case for views based on the Drupal Search API. Furthermore, the current Tripal Collections Views Handler form is geared towards displaying options for a single entity type.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nWe need to make a new Tripal Collections Views handler compatible with Drupal Search API views. Luckily, Tripal Collections already support collections containing multiple entity type (Tripal content types) so it's more a matter of supporting the generic query plugin for views and providing a good UI for choosing additional fields."
