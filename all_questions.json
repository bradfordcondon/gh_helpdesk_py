Anyway, when I do it in both places, I don't see anything similar to the example. No new fields related to functional modes showing. \r\nBut, if I go to \r\nStructure --> Content Types: \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43243429/49078613-67e4be00-f236-11e8-83fc-79d933430cf4.png)\r\n\r\nI find there content for Blast and Interpro. \r\n\r\nIs this how its supposed to be? \r\n\r\n        Thanks.\r\n"

However, the job keeps stalling at around 37% of parsed lines.\r\n\r\nThere is no error output from the Drush command. The Tripal Jobs list just says, \"Error.\" So I'm not sure how to troubleshoot.\r\n\r\nI first increased the PHP memory_limit value, as advised in the tutorial, to 2048M. I then raised it to 5120M. Both times, the job stalled at about 37% (36.74% for the former, 37.71% for the latter). It seems like the difference should have been much different if that was the issue, but I don't know.\r\n\r\nPlease advise if you have any advice on how to move past this stalling, with no clear error message, of a GFF load.\r\n\r\nThank you!"

    "body": "Hi there!\r\nI'm using tripal v3.0 (latest), Ubuntu 18.04.\r\n\r\nI'm a bit confused with the tripal legacy thing. If I understood well, legacy contains the previous tripal versions modules? in my new db I'm building, when I go to Find Tripal Content, I see what I am creating (organism, analyses, features.. etc). but in my home page, I see a Navigation panel, \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43243429/47367696-19dd1780-d6d8-11e8-9ec9-44d13969bb54.png)\r\n\r\nbut it seems to me that links me to \"legacy\" content? \r\nwhen I click in for example.. features: \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43243429/47367771-44c76b80-d6d8-11e8-95bb-b87402b13dbc.png)\r\nI dont see the blue links until I dont sync Features  going to Tripal- Tripal Legacy - Features - Sync.\r\nand then I see them.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43243429/47368062-dd5deb80-d6d8-11e8-923e-4d4aa53263c1.png)\r\n\r\nso, if I am right.. my question is: How can I have my Navigation Panel actually pointing to the same links than when I go to Find Tripal Content? is that even possible?  is it necessary then to sync everything all the time? \r\n\r\nThanks! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

And they want to maintain a history of previous versions.\r\n\r\nThey plan on incrementing a digit after the id when a new version is generated.\r\n\r\ngene nv2m00005394.1\r\nmRNA nv2m00005394.1.mRNA.1\r\n\r\n```\r\nChr11\tGFF3Conv\tgene\t3598792\t3603486\t.\t-\t.\tAlias=Sox9;Name=nv2m00005394.1;ID=nv2m00005394.1\r\nChr11\tGFF3Conv\tmRNA\t3598792\t3603486\t.\t-\t.\tID=nv2m00005394.1.mRNA.1;Parent=nv2m00005394.1\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nHow should I handle this? Create a new feature for each version and mark the old one obsolete? How do I make it easy for users to find the correct ID when they don't know there has been an update?  I have some ideas, but it would require the geneID and mRNAIDs to have different bases, ie nv2g00005394  (change g->m) for gene and nv2m00005394 for mRNA.\r\n\r\nAny advice would be fantastic!!!\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\nSofia\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is of type text, but we need to store numbers and want to be able to use this field as a numeric one, for example, to filter by these values in Views. The table has no data now. (This field is meant for comments and does not have any relationship with other fields/tables, so it does not seem to be a problem to change it.) The field type CAN be changed in psql, but this does not affect the way this table is seen by Drupal.\r\n\r\nI see that many change field types programmatically in Drupal using hook_update_N (with the functions db_query update and/or db_change_field). Looks like this way can only be used with public tables.\r\n\r\nCould you please hint how it is possible to change a field type in a Chado table? (Is it possible?)\r\nI was trying to access the Chado schema via different functions from the API like chado_get_schema(), and then use db_change_field, with no luck so far. Tripal API from other modules work fine, so there are some things which I seem to be missing here...\r\n\r\nIs this the way to do it? Or would you recommend something else?\r\n\r\nTripal 7-2.1\r\nChado 1.3\r\n"

So if you have only a single item, you can't have your select as `0` and your fieldset as `1`. This has caught me many times! Instead you should have `$element[0] = ['#type' => 'markup', '#tree' => TRUE];` then `$element[0]['select']` and `$element[0]['fieldset']`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo next question, why wont the callback ever fire?  I'm fairly certain this code would work if i were in a $form.\r\n\r\n"

The problem is that in this case, the entity record gets created in public.tripal_entity table BUT the corresponding chado_bio_data_<id> table does not get populated with the entity_id and record_id. I guess I'm missing something. How do I add that data via the code below? Any ideas? This is the only thing keeping me back from releasing the first version of Tripal Contact Profile module. Please let me know if you can\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n>\r\n\t\t\t$bundle = tripal_load_bundle_entity(array('name' => tripal_contact_profile_getMachineName()));\r\n\t\t\t$ec = entity_get_controller('TripalEntity');\r\n\t\t\t$entity = $ec->create(array(\r\n\t\t\t\t'bundle' => $bundle->name,\r\n\t\t\t\t'term_id' => $bundle->term_id,\r\n\t\t\t));\r\n\t\t\t$entity->name = $row->name;\r\n\t\t\t$entity->title = $row->name;\r\n\r\n"

    "body": "Tripal Version: 3\r\nDrupal Version: 7.56\r\nPostgreSQL Version: 9.5.12\r\nPHP Version: 7.0\r\n\r\nI'm trying to get tagsinput and typeahead working on my site that has the Bootstrap 3 theme. I've downloaded bootstrap-tagsinput.css and bootstrap-tagsinput.js from [here][1]. I've also downloaded bootstrap3-typeahead.js from [here][2]. Now the code I'm trying to use to get everything working is below:\r\n\r\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/sites/all/libraries/bootstrap-tagsinput/bootstrap-tagsinput.css\">\r\n    <script src=\"/sites/all/libraries/bootstrap-tagsinput/bootstrap-tagsinput.js\"></script>\r\n    <script src=\"/sites/all/libraries/bootstrap-typeahead/bootstrap-typeahead.js\"></script>\r\n    \r\n    <script type=\"jquery\">\r\n    $(\"input\").tagsinput({\r\n      typeahead: {\r\n        source: [\"Amsterdam\", \"Washington\", \"Sydney\", \"Beijing\", \"Cairo\"]\r\n      }\r\n    });\r\n    </script>\r\n    \r\n    <input type=\"text\" data-role=\"tagsinput\" placeholder=\"Add tags\" class=\"typeahead\" data-provide=\"typeahead\" autocomplete=\"off\" />\r\n\r\nNote: I'm relatively unfamiliar with jquery. No errors are returned when debugging. The tagsinput plugin works fine, but typeahead doesn't seem to work. The version of typeahead I chose should be compatible with Bootstrap 3. I'm currently avoiding using Twitter typeahead, which requires using Bootstrap LESS subtheme to avoid CSS conflicts.\r\n\r\nCould anything Tripal related cause issues? Any suggestions would be much appreciated. I've also submitted this question to stackoverflow and will update if/when I get a solution.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://codeload.github.com/bootstrap-tagsinput/bootstrap-tagsinput/zip/latest\r\n  [2]: https://github.com/bassjobsen/Bootstrap-3-Typeahead/blob/master/bootstrap3-typeahead.js"

    "body": "Tripal Versions: 2.x and 3.x (13/06/2018)\r\nDrupal Version: not relevant\r\nPostgreSQL Version: not relevant\r\nPHP Version: not relevant\r\n\r\nIn tripal_core.chado_query.api.inc, the chado_query function prefixes tables using the curly brackets {} for Chado tables and square brackets [] for Drupal tables. The following piece of code is currently used:\r\n```\r\n $chado_schema_name = chado_get_schema_name('chado');\r\n    $drupal_schema_name = chado_get_schema_name('drupal');\r\n    $sql = preg_replace('/\\{(.*?)\\}/', $chado_schema_name.'.$1', $sql);\r\n    $sql = preg_replace('/\\[(\\w+)\\]/', $drupal_schema_name.'.$1', $sql);\r\n```\r\nThis raises 2 issues:\r\n1) when the user wants to use curly or square brackets for other things that table names, it will be a problem. For instance, if I'd like to select any feature with a uniquename that begins with capital A or B, I would write a query like that (use \"drush php\" for testing):\r\n```\r\n$sql_query = \"SELECT * FROM {feature} WHERE uniquename ~ '^[AB]';\"\r\n$results = chado_query($sql_query);\r\ndrupal_set_message('Query: ' . $results->getQueryString());\r\n\r\n```\r\nSuch code will in fact return nothing while there should be some results as the query will be turned into:\r\n`SELECT * FROM chado.feature WHERE uniquename ~ '^public.AB';`\r\n\r\nThen\r\n\r\n2) replacing the square brackets with just \"public.\" will break Drupal behavior: Drupal uses curly brakets arround table names in order to prefix them with the database prefix used by the Drupal installation (@see https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/includes%21database%21database.inc/7.x ). For some reasons, people may want or need to prefix all Drupal tables with something and removing curly brackets around Drupal table names prevents Drupal from doing its job.\r\nSome people may wonder why using a table prefix: there are many cases in which it can actually be useful. The first one I think of is when you want to share Drupal users between several Drupal instances. It is possible to specify in your settings.php files that the user table are not prefixed while all the other Drupal tables are. Then when a user is created on a Drupal instance or another, it will be also created on other (well it's a bit more tricky than this but it works).\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm sorry I don't have a pull request to fix that (yet) and I didn't came up with a good solution yet but if people have ideas to discuss for a fix, feel free. I just wanted to raise the issue so it would be known and people having trouble using queries like mines would understand why sometimes, they might not have expected results... (and also, using Tripal prevents them from using Drupal table prefixing feature).\r\n"

    "body": "### Overview \r\n\r\nI'd like to define a field that has a widget that allows you to enter a file system path.  Then it will have a formatter that runs a javascript app on that file.  Nothing is stored in chado.\r\n\r\nTo this end I define a field instance where the widget is of type `text_textfield`, it uses a custom formatter, and it stores the text in type `field_sql_storage`. \r\nIs this the correct approach?  If so can I get some help with what I'm doing wrong?\r\n\r\n  for example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n $field_name = 'local__cmap_viewer';\r\n    $instances[$field_name] = [\r\n      'field_name' => $field_name,\r\n      'entity_type' => $entity_type,\r\n      'bundle' => $bundle->name,\r\n      'label' => 'cMap',\r\n      'description' => 'A cmap visualization field.',\r\n      'required' => FALSE,\r\n      'storage' => [\r\n        'type' => 'field_sql_storage',\r\n      ],\r\n      'settings' => [\r\n        'auto_attach' => FALSE,\r\n        'text_processing' => 0,\r\n        'max_length' => 10485760,\r\n      ],\r\n      'widget' => [\r\n        'type' => 'text_textfield',\r\n        'required' => FALSE,\r\n        'settings' => [\r\n        ],\r\n      ],\r\n      'display' => [\r\n        'default' => [\r\n          'label' => 'hidden',\r\n          'type' => 'local__cmap_viewer_formatter',\r\n          'settings' => [],\r\n        ],\r\n      ],\r\n    ];\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy [current attempt is here](https://github.com/statonlab/tripal_cmap_loader/blob/base_viewer_field/includes/tripal_cmap_loader.fields.inc).\r\n\r\nWhat i *can* do is create the field, and use the plain text field (it shows up as a widget).  however theres something wrong with the field storage and/or the widget configuration.\r\n\r\n### Problems\r\n\r\nNo matter what I get undefined indexed notices for the field widget when editing/creating. \r\n\r\n```\r\nNotice: Undefined index: max_length in text_field_widget_form() (line 514 of /Users/chet/UTK/tripal/modules/field/modules/text/text.module).\r\nNotice: Undefined index: text_processing in text_field_widget_form() (line 549 of /Users/chet/UTK/tripal/modules/field/modules/text/text.module).\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've tried adding these keys to the widget settings, and also to the field settings.\r\n\r\nfurthermore, the storage doesnt work: When I submit and go back to re-edit, the field is nulled."

I've seen that the jobs should call the tripal_chado::tripal_chado_publish_records callback to do this. So I have a function which creates this job using this callback.\r\n\r\nBut I have 2 problems:\r\n\r\n- the function needs a `bundle_name` like `bio_data_2` in the arguments. How can I determine this, given the bundle label (e.g. Analysis)?\r\n- there is a `filters` field to restrict publishing to some entities only. Can I use a chado id (e.g. analysis_id) to be sure to publish a specific entity?"

Or maybe I should just clone the github rather than using drush?"

I installed Tripal/Drupal using the rapid installation method recommended here (http://tripal.info/tutorials/v3.x/installation/rapid). I then checked the site. It at first said it could not access .htaccess -- I then changed permission on .htaccess in /var/ww/html from 640 to 644. The page then gave the following error:\r\n\r\n> This page isn’t working\r\n> 10.230.240.231 is currently unable to handle this request.\r\n> HTTP ERROR 500\r\n\r\nI have tried a number of troubleshooting approaches, including opening up permissions on other files in /var/www/html and re-running the installation. I also wrote a dummy index.html (\"hello world\" basic page) to see if that would load in place, and got the same error. So, I'm not sure if the issue is the .htaccess configuration associated with Tripal, an underlying Apache2 issue, or something else.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any recommendations.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nMichael"

    "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI need some help to find a way to store information about a protein superfamily and its subfamilies in a Chado database. \r\nThe overall structure is as follows:\r\n\r\n>superfamily\r\n>> family1 \r\n>>>type1 - protein1,  protein2\r\n>>>type2 - protein3\r\n>>>type3 - protein4, protein5\r\n\r\n>> family2 \r\n>>> type4 - protein6\r\n>>> type5 - ...\r\netc.\r\n\r\nI was thinking of two ways of doing this: either 1. via a property table or 2. via hierarchy of terms in a cv (is it possible?).\r\n\r\n1. Create new terms and use the featureprop table in a way similar to the one described here [https://sourceforge.net/p/gmod/mailman/gmod-schema/thread/1EA7B462-4D38-4628-93CD-BD3303322F29%40gmail.com/#msg36225490](url). But: how do we know that type1 belongs to family1 in this case?  \r\n\r\n2. Create a hierarchy of new terms: one for the superfamily and several for subfamilies, where each subfamily has several types. Each protein is then associated with one type (a type is a leaf in the hierarchy). \r\nIs it possible to define new terms with this hierarchical structure? \r\n\r\nOr is there another way of representing such a classification in Chado/Tripal? \r\n\r\nI have read about the Group module, but did not find how I can use it. There were also some methods on this page [http://generic-model-organism-system-database.450254.n5.nabble.com/Feature-Lists-td460032.html](url), but they are not \"hierarchical\" in the way that is required. \r\n\r\nI would be grateful for any hints or examples of doing this.\r\n\r\n"

OR a way to change each organism's tripal pane labels individually. \r\n\r\n## Why I'm requesting it\r\n\r\nI have two cases so far where I want the Tripal Pane to have a different display name based on properties of the bundle. One is our \"Transcriptome/Genome\" field attached to organism, which links out to the corresponding analysis.  They are both analysis unigenes but I split them, entirely because I wanted the tripal pane to say genome/transcriptome as appropriate.\r\n\r\nI now have another case, for Jbrowse.  For our draft genomes, Jbrowse is an alignment to a reference. For our reference genomes, Jbrowse is the ref sequence with annotations.  We are thinking about having the tripal pane say something other than Jbrowse for the drafts.  But the only way I know of to do this right now is to create two Jbrowse fields, and put each one in an appropriately labeled Tripal Pane."

The [Tripal Relation Module](https://github.com/bradfordcondon/tripal_relation) finds relation types that are between Tripal Entity and provides support for Chado-linking them to autogenerate relationships.  The result is you get \"free\" fields from the relation module to display related entities (all the biomaterials for an organism, all the analyses with a biomaterial, etc) if you can link them in Chado.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnfortunately there is a hook naming problem.  The relation module defines this callback function: \r\n\r\n```\r\n/**\r\n * Callback to create a relation.\r\n */\r\nfunction relation_entity_create($values = array()) {\r\n    $relation = relation_create($values['relation_type'], []);\r\n    foreach ($values as $key => $value) {\r\n      $relation->{$key} = $value;\r\n    }\r\n    return $relation;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis accidentally hooks into entity_create hook defined in `TripalEntityController`.\r\n\r\nWhat's the best way for me to resolve this?  Maybe the Tripal hook could ignore the relation module?"

    "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nWe are wondering if there is a way to hook into the bundle create form to alter the form. For example, when creating a new Gene, we'd like to alter the options of the organisms field programmatically by running an SQL query. Since running SQL is not possible through the GUI, we'd need a way to do this programmatically.\r\n\r\nThis is most useful to us when modifying fields that Tripal Bundles automatically create using the tripal_create_bundle function. Currently, we can't find a way to alter the form without creating a full blown TripalField to do a simple task.\r\n\r\nDoes a hook already exists that we can use to alter the form?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    "body": "When following the Tripal 3 tutorial (http://tripal.info/tutorials/v3.x/installation/tripal), you\r\n1. Install Tripal Core\r\n2. Install Tripal Chado\r\n3. Install Chado schema & prepare chado/drupal (created basic content types including organism)\r\n4. Install Tripal DS\r\n\r\nFollowing this workflow I don't get the default arrangement of Tripal Panes for all the original basic content types created via preparing your Chado/Drupal database. Tripal panes are available as a group formatter and the layout is available but I would have to build the hierarchy myself.\r\n\r\nHowever, any new content types I create (e.g. genetic_marker) will have the default layout. In other words, Any **content types existing before Tripal DS is enabled are not getting a default arrangement**; where as, **content types created after Tripal DS is enabled are**.\r\n\r\nThis is incongruent with the tutorial which shows the organism and analysis as having Tripal Panes when following the current order of the tutorial doesn't actually produce that effect.\r\n\r\nDo we want to apply default grouping on pre-existing Tripal Content Types? We would run the risk of overriding custom settings if we did... That said, if we don't then what about those admin that don't enable Tripal DS to begin with thinking they want to customize everything themselves and then change their mind after realizing how much work it is ;-). Thoughts?"
